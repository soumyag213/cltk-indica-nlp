# # CommandLine Usage

This function can be used to break down into morphemes all the words present in the input text, it works by using a third library called morfessor (which will have to be specifically downloaded to run this feature). The function call is as follows: 


```python
python3 indic_morph.py <input file> <output file> <lang code> <directory path to resources>
```
